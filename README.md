# Similar-Images-Searcher
This was the final project for the subject digital image and video processing. Based on a 2000 image database (UKentuckyDatabase) I created and algorithm where you give it an image and it gives you an array of the most similar ones. In the database there are 4 "similar images" per image(including the original). So the F score is calculated that way
